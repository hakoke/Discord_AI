## ServerMate Discord Bot — Terms of Service

_Last updated: November 17, 2025_

### 1. Acceptance of Terms
By installing, inviting, or interacting with the ServerMate Discord bot (the “Bot”), you agree to this Terms of Service (“Terms”) on behalf of yourself and any community or server you manage. If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.

### 2. Eligibility and Administrator Responsibility
- You must have the authority to manage the Discord server where the Bot operates and to grant it the permissions listed in `README.md`.
- Server administrators are responsible for informing their members about these Terms and for configuring Bot permissions, channels, and roles appropriately.

### 3. Description of Service
ServerMate is an AI-powered assistant that:
- Responds to Discord messages, mentions, replies, and commands.
- Uses multiple Google Gemini models for text, reasoning, and vision tasks.
- Can analyze, generate, and edit images via Google Vertex AI / Imagen.
- Maintains a PostgreSQL-backed memory system that stores conversation context, user traits, and learned behaviors.
- Provides optional web search via the Serper API.
Features may evolve without notice.

### 4. User Obligations
- **Accuracy**: Do not rely on the Bot for professional, medical, legal, or financial advice.
- **Content Ownership**: You are responsible for all content you or your members submit via the Bot.
- **Permissions**: Do not grant the Bot broader Discord permissions than needed.
- **Compliance**: You must ensure your server complies with Discord’s Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and applicable laws.

### 5. Prohibited Conduct
You agree not to:
- Use the Bot for illegal, harmful, or abusive purposes.
- Attempt to extract private data about other users beyond what Discord exposes.
- Reverse engineer, probe, or misuse the Bot, its APIs, or its database.
- Interfere with the Bot’s infrastructure or rate limits.

### 6. AI Output and Limitations
- The Bot may generate inaccurate, offensive, or unexpected content, especially because it is intentionally uncensored and mirrors user tone.
- Outputs are provided “as-is” without guarantees of accuracy, safety, or suitability.
- You must moderate your community accordingly and use the `!forget` or any provided controls to delete content you deem inappropriate.

### 7. Memory and Data Handling
- The Bot stores message content, metadata (channel IDs, user IDs, timestamps), AI responses, and internal memory notes inside PostgreSQL as described in the repository documentation.
- Memory persists across restarts until deleted via administrator tools, commands, or database maintenance.
- You are responsible for informing your members that their interactions may be stored and for honoring deletion requests within your server or jurisdiction.

### 8. Third-Party Services
- The Bot relies on Discord, Google Cloud (Gemini, Vertex AI), PostgreSQL hosting (e.g., Railway), and optional Serper search.
- Your use is also governed by the respective third-party terms and privacy policies.

### 9. Disclaimers
- THE BOT IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
- We do not guarantee uptime, accuracy, or compatibility with every Discord server configuration.
- AI-driven decisions (model selection, memory formation, generated images) may fail or behave unpredictably.

### 10. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the Bot. Direct damages, if any, are limited to USD $50 or the amount you paid for the Bot (whichever is less).

### 11. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Bot developers from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from your or your community’s use of the Bot or violation of these Terms.

### 12. Suspension or Termination
We may suspend or terminate the Bot’s availability, or your access to it, at any time with or without notice, including for suspected abuse or security concerns.

### 13. Updates to the Terms
We may revise these Terms by posting an updated version in the repository. Continued use of the Bot after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.

### 14. Contact
For questions about these Terms, open an issue in the repository or reach out via the contact method listed in `README.md` or accompanying documentation.
